# CSV to KML converter 

Can be used to create simulations of any data and visualize how it changes over time. Format the file names in by day, month, then year with hyphens between each, then the time in parenthesis followed with min or hr. Example: 02-Jul-09 (75.000 min) 

This allows the program to automatically read in the time and include it into the kml file.
